# Slack Event Handling and Verification Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for handling and verifying Slack events in the bot.

## Components

### 1. Request Verification
- Extract `X-Slack-Signature` and `X-Slack-Request-Timestamp` from headers
- Verify that the timestamp is not too old (prevent replay attacks)
- Create a signature using the signing secret and request body
- Compare the signatures to verify authenticity

### 2. URL Verification
- Handle the initial URL verification challenge from Slack
- Respond with the challenge parameter to confirm the endpoint

### 3. Event Parsing and Routing
- Parse the event payload to identify the event type
- Route events to appropriate handlers based on type
- Handle message events from users

## Implementation Details

### Signature Verification Process
1. Extract timestamp and signature from headers
2. Create the basestring: `v0:${timestamp}:${body}`
3. Hash the basestring with HMAC-SHA256 using the signing secret
4. Prefix the hash with `v0=` to create the signature
5. Compare with the signature from the header

### Event Types to Handle
1. `url_verification` - Initial verification challenge
2. `event_callback` - Actual events from Slack
   - `message` - User messages that the bot should respond to

### Response Handling
- For `url_verification`: Respond with the challenge
- For `event_callback`: Respond with a 200 OK immediately, then process the event
